# Synopsis

This script will disable accounts from Active Directory that have been inactive for 35 days and move them to an alternative location.

## Notes

The requirement for disabling accounts after 35 days due to non-use is a Security Technical Implementation Guideline (STIG) requirement mandated by Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA). The STIG stipulates that all accounts are to be disabled after 35 days of inactivity/no access.
